## Writing Rules

### DO:
‚úÖ Use active voice ("I launched" not "The product was launched")
‚úÖ Lead with metrics, then explain how
‚úÖ Show specific examples and concrete details
‚úÖ Include both successes and honest reflections
‚úÖ Provide context for every metric
‚úÖ Use headers and bullets for scanability

### DON'T:
‚ùå Use vague language ("improved significantly")
‚ùå Take credit for team work without acknowledgment
‚ùå Include jargon without explanation
‚ùå Lead with your actions before the problem
‚ùå Share metrics without timeframes or context
‚ùå Write walls of text without visual breaks

## Metrics Best Practices

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too vague:** "Improved metrics significantly"
   ‚Üí Fix: "Increased retention from 45% to 60% in 3 months"

2. **Feature-focused:** "Launched X feature with Y functionality"
   ‚Üí Fix: "Launched X feature solving [problem], driving [metric]"

3. **No context:** "Grew users by 100K"
   ‚Üí Fix: "Grew users from 50K to 150K (3x) in 6 months, vs. 30% industry growth"

4. **All wins:** "Everything succeeded perfectly"
   ‚Üí Fix: Include honest challenges and learnings

5. **Team credit unclear:** "I did everything"
   ‚Üí Fix: "I led a cross-functional team of 8 to..."

6. **Jargon-heavy:** "Leveraged synergistic paradigms to optimize KPIs"
   ‚Üí Fix: Use plain language with specific examples
