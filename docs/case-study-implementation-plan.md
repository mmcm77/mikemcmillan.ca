## Writing Tips for Success

### Before You Write
1. **Complete the worksheet fully** - Don't start writing until you have all data
2. **Print the quick reference guide** - Keep it next to you while writing
3. **Block dedicated time** - 2-3 hour focused sessions work best
4. **Eliminate distractions** - Turn off Slack, email, phone

### While You Write
1. **Start with Impact section** - Knowing the outcome helps frame the story
2. **Write Problem section next** - Sets up the narrative tension
3. **Don't self-edit while drafting** - Get words down, polish later
4. **Use placeholders for missing info** - [INSERT METRIC] and keep going
5. **Take breaks between sections** - Fresh eyes catch issues

### After You Write
1. **Read aloud** - Catches awkward phrasing
2. **Cut 20%** - First drafts are always too long
3. **Get external feedback** - You're too close to the work
4. **Sleep on it** - Come back with fresh perspective
5. **Proofread 3x** - Once for content, once for flow, once for typos

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "I don't remember specific metrics"
**Solutions:**
- Check old performance reviews
- Review presentation decks from that period
- Look at LinkedIn posts/updates from that time
- Ask former colleagues
- Use analytics tools if still have access
- Be transparent: "grew integrations 3x" if exact numbers unavailable

### Challenge: "This work was collaborative, how do I claim credit?"
**Solutions:**
- Use "I led..." or "As product lead, I..."
- Acknowledge team: "I coordinated a cross-functional team of X..."
- Focus on your specific contributions (strategy, decisions, coordination)
- It's not bragging to own your work

### Challenge: "Some information is confidential"
**Solutions:**
- Anonymize sensitive data
- Use percentages instead of absolute numbers
- Get company approval if needed
- Focus on strategic approach over proprietary details
- Generalize specifics that are under NDA

### Challenge: "I'm not a good writer"
**Solutions:**
- Follow the templates exactly - they do the work for you
- Use bullet points liberally
- Write how you'd explain it to a friend
- Hire an editor for the final polish
- Use AI for first draft, then personalize heavily

### Challenge: "I don't have design skills for visuals"
**Solutions:**
- Use Figma templates (many free PM portfolio templates)
- Hire a designer on Upwork ($200-500 per case study)
- Use Canva for charts and graphics
- Screenshot analytics dashboards
- Keep it simple - clean charts beat fancy graphics

## Portfolio Integration

### Technical Implementation (Next.js)

**Create route structure:**
```
src/app/
  case-studies/
    page.tsx              # Case studies index/gallery
    layout.tsx            # Shared layout for case studies
    [slug]/
      page.tsx            # Dynamic case study page
```

**Recommended approach:**
1. Create MDX files for each case study
2. Use `next-mdx-remote` for rendering
3. Store case study data in `/content/case-studies/`
4. Build gallery page showing all case studies
5. Add case study previews on homepage

**Metadata for each:**
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: "Scaling Open Finance Across Africa | Mike McMillan",
  description: "Product Lead case study: How I expanded Okra...",
  openGraph: {
    images: ['/og-images/okra-case-study.png'],
  },
}
```

### Design System Considerations

**Case study components to build:**
- `<CaseStudyHero>` - Hero section with stats
- `<MetricCard>` - Individual metric display
- `<BeforeAfter>` - Comparison slider
- `<Timeline>` - Process timeline
- `<QuoteBlock>` - User testimonials
- `<ImageGallery>` - Screenshot gallery
- `<CallToAction>` - End-of-case-study CTA

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Use consistent spacing (your 4px base unit)
- Typography scale for different content types
- Color system: primary for metrics, accent for highlights
- Dark mode support (already have `bg-black`)

## Final Thoughts

**The goal isn't perfection.** The goal is shipping three compelling stories that demonstrate your strategic thinking, execution excellence, and business impact.

**Start with Okra.** It has the clearest metrics and most recent memory. Use it to establish your process. The second and third will go faster.

**Timebox your work.** It's easy to overthink. Follow the weekly schedule. Done and published beats perfect and unpublished.

**Iterate after launch.** You'll get feedback once it's live. Use that to improve. Version 1.1 is better than never launching.

**Your case studies are your product.** Apply the same PM discipline you'd use for any product:
- Understand your audience (hiring managers)
- Solve their problem (proving you can deliver)
- Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- Measure what matters (interviews, offers)

---

## Your Mission

**By Week 12, you will have:**
- ✅ 3 published case studies showcasing 10+ years of PM work
- ✅ Portfolio positioning you as strategic, execution-focused PM
- ✅ LinkedIn content generating engagement and opportunities
- ✅ Interview materials that demonstrate proven impact
- ✅ Confidence in your ability to tell compelling product stories

**This is how you land your next great PM role.**

**Let's ship it.** 🚀
