# Content Strategy Analysis & Recommendations
## Elevating Mike McMillan's PM Portfolio to Top 1%

**Analysis Date:** October 29, 2025
**Current State:** Solid foundation with career timeline, lacking depth in storytelling and evidence

---

## Executive Summary

Your portfolio has strong bones—impressive metrics ($50M+ raised, 100+ products), senior roles at notable companies, and a clean technical implementation. However, it's currently operating at **60-70% of its potential** due to missing elements that distinguish top 1% PM portfolios.

**Primary Gap:** You're telling readers WHAT you did, but not WHY it mattered, HOW you approached problems, or WHAT you learned. Top portfolios are case study-driven narratives that prove product thinking, not resume-style chronologies.

**Quick Win Potential:** High. With your experience at Okra, Buildable, and Bookmark, you have 3-4 compelling stories that could each become showcase case studies.

---

## 1. Storytelling & Narrative Analysis

### Current State: 6/10

**What's Working:**
- Clear career progression from Marketing → PM → Head of Product → Product Lead
- Concrete geographic expansion story (Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya at Okra)
- Validation points: acquisitions, funding rounds, recognizable clients

**What's Missing:**
- **No narrative arc connecting experiences** - Why did you move from sports media to storage auctions to website builders to fintech? What's the throughline?
- **Surface-level descriptions** - "Launched 100+ products" is impressive but vague. Which ones mattered most? Why?
- **Absent user stories** - Who did you build for? What problems kept them up at night?
- **No failure or challenge narratives** - All wins, no obstacles overcome

### Top 1% Standard:

Exceptional PM portfolios read like **compelling product case studies**, not job descriptions. They follow this narrative structure:

```
The World as It Was → The Problem We Discovered →
The Bet We Made → The Obstacles We Faced →
The Solution We Shipped → The Impact We Measured →
What I'd Do Differently
```

**Example from Top Portfolio (Sherlaine):**
Instead of: "Led redesign of checkout flow"
They wrote: "Our checkout had 67% cart abandonment. After 23 user interviews, we discovered users didn't trust our security. We redesigned around trust signals and dropped abandonment to 31% in 8 weeks."

### Recommendations:

#### Immediate (Week 1-2):

1. **Add a "Career Philosophy" Section to Home Page**
   - Replace generic "My Approach" with your unique perspective
   - Example angle: "I build products for emerging markets where infrastructure doesn't exist yet—from African fintech to storage auction marketplaces. I specialize in creating the category, not competing in it."

2. **Rewrite Work Entries as Mini-Stories**
   - Current: "Launched 100+ products across 3 core segments"
   - Better: "In 2020, Okra had 8 bank integrations and served 12 companies. By 2024, we powered 100+ products across 150+ financial institutions, processing 2M+ API calls daily for fintechs like [client names]. Here's how we scaled infrastructure while maintaining 99.9% uptime..."

3. **Add "Why I Joined" + "Why I Left" for Each Role**
   - Shows intentionality and career strategy
   - Example: "I joined Okra as their first product hire because I saw an opportunity to build Africa's Plaid before anyone else did. I left after achieving our Series B goals to [next adventure]."

#### High-Impact (Month 1):

4. **Create "The Thread" Section**
   - A 3-4 paragraph narrative on your home page
   - Connects: sports media → ecommerce → AI website builders → African fintech → [next]
   - Positions your superpower: Pattern recognition in nascent markets

5. **Develop a "Product Philosophy" Manifesto**
   - 5-7 principles that guide your PM decisions
   - Example principles based on your work:
     - "Build for mobile-first, infrastructure-last markets"
     - "Launch fast, iterate faster—100 products taught me speed beats perfection"
     - "Product-market fit in Africa looks different than Silicon Valley"
     - "Developer experience is user experience for B2B products"

---

## 2. Impact & Metrics Analysis

### Current State: 5/10

**What's Working:**
- High-level metrics on home page (10+ years, $50M+, 100+ products)
- Funding links provide credibility
- Geographic expansion metrics (3 countries)

**What's Missing:**
- **No velocity metrics** - How fast did you move? Timeline context missing
- **No before/after comparisons** - What was the state when you joined vs. when you left?
- **No user/customer numbers** - "Launched 100+ products" for how many users? Businesses?
- **No efficiency metrics** - Time saved, cost reduced, processes improved
- **No team impact** - How many people did you lead? Hire? Develop?
- **No failure metrics** - What didn't work? What did you kill?

### Top 1% Standard:

Elite PM portfolios use **layered metrics** that tell a complete story:

1. **Input Metrics** (effort/investment): "3-person team, 6-month timeline, $200K budget"
2. **Process Metrics** (execution): "43 user interviews, 12 prototypes tested, 8 iterations"
3. **Output Metrics** (shipped): "Launched to 14 countries, 3 platform variants, 99.9% uptime"
4. **Outcome Metrics** (impact): "2M users, $12M ARR, 45% conversion improvement"
5. **Learning Metrics** (growth): "Validated 3 hypotheses, invalidated 2, discovered edge case that became new product"

**Example from Top Portfolio (Nicolas @ Okta):**
"Redesigned authentication flow to reduce friction while maintaining security. Through A/B testing with 50K users, we increased completion rate from 73% to 91% (18pp lift), reducing support tickets by 34% and saving $280K annually in support costs. Most importantly, we validated that progressive disclosure works better than one-page forms for enterprise users—a pattern we've now applied across 6 other products."

### Recommendations:

#### Immediate (Week 1-2):

1. **Quantify Every Achievement with 3-Number Rule**
   - Every bullet should have: scale + impact + timeframe
   - Current: "Launched 100+ products"
   - Better: "Launched 100+ API/UI products in 4 years (2.1 products/month avg), growing from 8 bank integrations to 150+ institutions, powering $2B+ in transaction volume"

2. **Add Comparison Metrics**
   ```
   When I Joined (May 2020):
   - 8 bank integrations
   - 12 B2B customers
   - 1 country (Nigeria)
   - 2 product engineers

   When I Left (Feb 2024):
   - 150+ financial institutions
   - 100+ B2B customers
   - 3 countries (NG, SA, KE)
   - 15-person product + eng team
   - Position: Africa's #1 open finance API
   ```

3. **Create "Impact Snapshot" Cards for Each Role**
   - Visual metrics cards (similar to your home page stats)
   - Okra card: "100+ Products | 3 Markets | 150+ Integrations | 4 Years"
   - Bookmark card: "Acquired in 2019 | $XM Exit | AI Positioning | 2 Years"

#### High-Impact (Month 1):

4. **Build Interactive Metrics Dashboard**
   - Use data visualization for key metrics
   - Timeline showing product launch velocity over time
   - Geographic expansion map
   - Product category breakdown (40% data APIs, 30% identity, 30% payments)

5. **Add "By the Numbers" Section to Home**
   - Comprehensive metrics dashboard
   - Categories: Products Shipped, Capital Influenced, Markets Entered, Teams Built, Users Impacted
   - Example: "2M+ API calls daily" or "Processed $2B+ in transactions"

6. **Create Metrics Narrative**
   - Don't just list numbers—explain what they mean
   - "100+ products might sound like feature bloat, but in open finance infrastructure, each 'product' is a new bank integration that took 2-3 months of negotiation, legal, and technical implementation. We were building market access, not features."

---

## 3. Case Study Recommendations

### Current State: 1/10

**Critical Gap:** You have ZERO detailed case studies. This is the biggest weakness holding your portfolio back from top tier.

### Why This Matters:

Job descriptions show you were there. Case studies prove you can **think like a PM**. Senior PM roles at Google, Stripe, Shopify, etc. expect to see:
- Problem decomposition skills
- User research methodology
- Prioritization frameworks
- Cross-functional leadership
- Data-driven decision making
- Iterative improvement cycles

Without case studies, hiring managers must take your word for it. With case studies, they see your mind work.

### Top 1% Standard:

Exceptional portfolios feature **3-5 deep-dive case studies** following this structure:

#### The STAR+ Framework (Expanded for Portfolios):

1. **Context & Challenge (Situation)**
   - Market landscape: What was the competitive environment?
   - User/customer problem: What pain point existed?
   - Business constraint: Why was this hard to solve?
   - Success metrics defined upfront: What does good look like?

2. **Strategic Approach (Task)**
   - Problem decomposition: How did you break down the challenge?
   - Framework applied: CIRCLES, Jobs-to-be-Done, Value vs. Complexity matrix?
   - Hypotheses formed: What did you believe would work?
   - Stakeholder alignment: How did you get buy-in?

3. **Execution Process (Action)**
   - Discovery: User research, data analysis, competitive analysis
   - Ideation: How many concepts? What criteria filtered them?
   - Prototyping: Fidelity levels, testing approach
   - Building: Team structure, sprint planning, technical challenges
   - Launch: GTM strategy, rollout plan, success metrics

4. **Measurable Impact (Result)**
   - Quantitative outcomes: Usage, revenue, efficiency metrics
   - Qualitative outcomes: User feedback, team morale, market position
   - Before/after comparison: Clear delta
   - Timeline: How long did this take?

5. **Learning & Evolution (Reflection)**
   - What worked better than expected?
   - What didn't work? What would you do differently?
   - How did this inform future decisions?
   - What's the scalable insight?

### Recommended Case Studies for Your Portfolio:

Based on your work history, here are **5 high-potential case studies**:

#### 1. **Okra: Building Africa's Open Finance Infrastructure from Zero**

- **Challenge:** How do you make financial APIs that developers actually want to use?
- **Approach:** Treat developer experience as core product, not afterthought
- **Process:** Documentation-first development, interactive API explorer, SDK strategy
- **Impact:** Developer NPS, integration time reduction, viral growth through word-of-mouth
- **Learning:** For B2B infrastructure, developer experience IS user experience

**Why This Works:** Shows deep understanding of B2B product dynamics and technical empathy.

**Estimated Time to Write:** 6-8 hours

---

#### 5. **Bid13: Geographic Expansion Strategy (Canada → USA → Australia)**
**Theme:** Market expansion, localization, operational scaling

**Story Arc:**
- **Context:** Niche marketplace proven in Canada, expansion opportunity
- **Challenge:** How do you expand to new markets with different regulations?
- **Approach:** Sequenced expansion with localization strategy
- **Process:** Market research, regulatory compliance, supply-side strategy
- **Impact:** 3 countries, X% revenue growth, market leadership
- **Learning:** Same product, different go-to-market in each geography

**Why This Works:** Shows market expansion thinking and operational excellence.

**Estimated Time to Write:** 5-7 hours

## 4. Content Gaps Analysis

### What Top 1% Portfolios Have That Yours Lacks:

#### Missing Content Type #1: Product Thinking Artifacts

**What It Is:** Visual evidence of your process—wireframes, user flows, PRDs, roadmap snapshots, data dashboards

**Why It Matters:** Shows HOW you think, not just WHAT you built

**Examples from Top Portfolios:**
- Whiteboard sketches from planning sessions
- Before/after wireframes
- User research synthesis (affinity mapping)
- Prioritization frameworks (value vs. effort matrices)
- A/B test result dashboards
- Product roadmap timelines

**Implementation for You:**
- Create "Process Gallery" section in each case study
- Include: user journey maps, API architecture diagrams, prioritization matrices
- Add captions explaining each artifact's role in decision-making

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours per case study (recreate key artifacts)

---

#### Missing Content Type #2: User Stories & Testimonials

**What It Is:** Real customer voices describing the impact of your work

**Why It Matters:** Third-party validation is more credible than self-reported achievements

**Examples from Top Portfolios:**
- Direct quotes from users: "Before Okra, integrating with banks took 6 months. Now it takes 2 weeks."
- Customer success stories: "How Company X used Okra to..."
- Team testimonials: What your engineers/designers say about working with you
- Stakeholder endorsements: CEO/CTO quotes about your impact

**Implementation for You:**
- Reach out to 5-10 former colleagues, clients, or partners
- Ask specific questions: "What problem did I help you solve?" "What was the before/after?"
- Create "What Others Say" section on work page
- Add testimonials to relevant case studies

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours outreach + compilation

---

#### Missing Content Type #3: Product Screenshots & Demos

**What It Is:** Visual proof of what you built—actual product screenshots, demo videos, interactive prototypes

**Why It Matters:** Makes abstract achievements tangible. "Launched 100+ products" becomes real when you see them.

**Examples from Top Portfolios:**
- Product screenshot galleries with annotations
- Short demo videos (30-60 seconds)
- Interactive prototypes embedded in portfolio
- GIFs showing key interactions
- Before/after comparison sliders

**Implementation for You:**
- Gather screenshots from Okra, Buildable, Bookmark products
- Create annotated versions highlighting key features
- Build image carousels for each case study
- Consider short Loom videos explaining product decisions

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours per case study

---

#### Missing Content Type #4: Thought Leadership Content

**What It Is:** Published articles, frameworks, or insights that demonstrate expertise

**Why It Matters:** Positions you as an expert, not just practitioner. Shows you can synthesize learnings.

**Examples from Top Portfolios:**
- Medium/Substack articles on PM topics
- LinkedIn posts analyzing product decisions
- Original frameworks or methodologies
- Speaking engagements or podcast appearances
- Open-source tools or templates

**Implementation for You:**

**Potential Articles Based on Your Experience:**
1. "Building Financial Infrastructure in Emerging Markets: Lessons from Scaling Okra"
2. "Why Developer Experience is the Only Moat for API Businesses"
3. "From Agency to Product: How to Productize Services (Buildable Case Study)"
4. "The Product Manager's Guide to Geographic Expansion"
5. "100+ Products in 4 Years: How to Ship Fast Without Breaking Things"

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours per article (1,500-2,000 words)

---

#### Missing Content Type #5: Skills & Competencies Evidence

**What It Is:** Concrete proof of PM skills through examples, not just listed

**Why It Matters:** "Strong analytical skills" means nothing. "Analyzed 50K user sessions to identify drop-off points" proves it.

**Top 1% Approach:**

Instead of listing:
- ✗ User Research
- ✗ Data Analysis
- ✗ Roadmap Planning
- ✗ Stakeholder Management

Show evidence:
- ✓ User Research: "Conducted 40+ customer interviews across Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya to understand regional banking differences"
- ✓ Data Analysis: "Built SQL dashboards tracking API latency, error rates, and usage patterns across 150+ integrations"
- ✓ Roadmap Planning: "Managed 18-month product roadmap balancing 3 product lines, 12 engineers, and 100+ customer requests"
- ✓ Stakeholder Management: "Led quarterly business reviews with C-suite, translating technical product strategy into business outcomes"

**Implementation for You:**
- Create "Skills in Action" section
- For each core PM skill, provide 2-3 specific examples from your work
- Link examples to case studies for deeper exploration

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

#### Missing Content Type #6: Failure Stories & Lessons Learned

**What It Is:** Honest accounts of what didn't work and what you learned

**Why It Matters:** Shows maturity, self-awareness, and growth mindset. Everyone fails—great PMs learn from it.

**Examples from Top Portfolios:**
- "The feature we killed after 3 months because users didn't care"
- "How I misread the market and pivoted based on data"
- "The A/B test that proved me wrong"
- "What I'd do differently if I could start over"

**Implementation for You:**

**Potential Failure Stories:**
1. "The API design we had to deprecate because developers hated it"
2. "The market we entered too early and had to retreat from"
3. "The product I championed that no one used—and what I learned"
4. "How we over-engineered our first product and learned to ship faster"

**Why This Is Powerful:** Senior PMs are expected to make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information. Showing you can fail, learn, and adapt is MORE valuable than only showing wins.

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours per story (500-800 words)

---

#### Missing Content Type #7: Process & Methodology Documentation

**What It Is:** How you work—your PM playbook, frameworks, rituals

**Why It Matters:** Shows you're systematic, not just reactive. Demonstrates leadership ability.

**Examples from Top Portfolios:**
- "My Product Discovery Process" (step-by-step guide)
- "How I Run Sprint Planning"
- "My Framework for Prioritization"
- "The Questions I Ask in Every User Interview"
- "My Template for Product Requirements Documents"

**Implementation for You:**

**Potential Process Documentation:**
1. **"How I Prioritize 100+ Feature Requests"**
   - Your prioritization framework (probably some combo of RICE, value vs. effort, strategic alignment)
   - Real example from Okra: "How we decided to build payments vs. double down on data APIs"

2. **"My Approach to Market Expansion"**
   - Framework used for Nigeria → South Africa → Kenya expansion
   - Criteria for market selection, sequencing strategy, localization checklist

3. **"Building Products for Developers: My B2B PM Playbook"**
   - How to do user research with developers (they're different)
   - What metrics matter for API products
   - Documentation-first development approach

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours per process guide

---

### Content Gaps Summary Table:

| Content Type | Current State | Top 1% Standard | Priority | Estimated Effort |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| Case Studies | 0 detailed | 3-5 deep dives | **CRITICAL** | 40-50 hours |
| Product Artifacts | None visible | 10-15 per case study | **HIGH** | 20-30 hours |
| User Testimonials | None | 5-10 quotes | **HIGH** | 3-5 hours |
| Screenshots/Demos | None | Gallery per project | **HIGH** | 15-20 hours |
| Thought Leadership | None | 3-5 articles | **MEDIUM** | 20-30 hours |
| Skills Evidence | Listed only | Proven with examples | **MEDIUM** | 3-4 hours |
| Failure Stories | None | 2-3 candid accounts | **MEDIUM** | 6-9 hours |
| Process Docs | None | 2-3 frameworks | **LOW** | 12-18 hours |

**Total Estimated Effort to Reach Top 1%:** 120-165 hours (3-4 months at 10 hours/week)

---

## 5. Value Proposition Analysis

### Current State: 4/10

**What Your Portfolio Currently Communicates:**

"I'm an experienced product manager who has worked at multiple companies and helped them grow."

**Problem:** This describes 80% of PM candidates. Not differentiated.

### What Top 1% Portfolios Communicate:

"I'm the person you hire when [specific situation] because I've demonstrated [unique capability] through [concrete results]."

**Examples:**

- **Julie Zhuo:** "I'm the person you hire to build design-led product culture at scale, as proven by growing Meta's design team from 30 to 300+ and creating frameworks used industry-wide."

- **Lenny Rachitsky:** "I'm the person you hire to crack growth and monetization for marketplaces, as proven by Airbnb's payments and host growth work."

- **Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google):** "I'm the person you hire to bring product rigor and frameworks to fast-growing companies, as proven by my work establishing PM practice at Stripe."

### Your Hidden Value Proposition:

Based on your work history, here's what makes you uniquely valuable (but isn't clearly communicated):

#### Option 1: The Emerging Market Infrastructure Specialist
**Positioning:** "I build infrastructure products in markets where the infrastructure doesn't exist yet."

**Evidence:**
- Okra: Built open finance APIs before African banks had APIs
- Bid13: Created marketplace infrastructure for a niche with no digital solution
- Buildable: Built integration infrastructure for companies lacking technical resources

**When to hire you:** "When you're entering a new market or category and need to build the foundational layer, not just compete on features."

**Tagline:** "Building the rails before the trains arrive"

---

#### Option 2: The 0-to-100 Product Velocity Expert
**Positioning:** "I ship at exceptional velocity without sacrificing quality—100+ products in 4 years."

**Evidence:**
- 2.1 products per month average at Okra
- Transformed Buildable from agency to 20+ microservices in 1 year
- Scaled Bookmark from MVP to acquisition-ready in 2 years

**When to hire you:** "When you need to move fast in a competitive market and require a PM who can maintain velocity while building technical depth."

**Tagline:** "Ship fast, scale faster"

---

#### Option 3: The Product-to-Platform Architect
**Positioning:** "I transform single products into multi-product platforms."

**Evidence:**
- Okra: 1 product → 100+ product ecosystem across 3 categories
- Buildable: Agency services → productized microservices platform
- Bookmark: Website builder → AI-powered platform

**When to hire you:** "When your single product is succeeding and you need to expand into a platform play without losing focus."

**Tagline:** "From product to platform"

---

#### Option 4: The Cross-Continental Product Leader
**Positioning:** "I lead product expansion across multiple markets with different technical and regulatory landscapes."

**Evidence:**
- Okra: 3 African countries with different banking systems
- Bid13: Canada, USA, Australia with different regulations
- Buildable: Enterprise clients across North America

**When to hire you:** "When you need someone who understands that the same product requires different approaches in different markets."

**Tagline:** "Global product thinking, local market execution"

---

### Recommended Value Proposition:

**Primary:** The Emerging Market Infrastructure Specialist
**Secondary:** The 0-to-100 Product Velocity Expert

**Why:** These two are most differentiated and supported by evidence. They also position you for high-growth opportunities.

### Implementation:

#### Home Page Hero Section Rewrite:

**Current:**
> "Building products that scale. Product leader with a decade of experience in product management, strategy, and go-to-market execution."

**Recommended:**
> "Building infrastructure products in markets where the infrastructure doesn't exist yet."
>
> "Product leader specializing in emerging market infrastructure—from African open finance to niche marketplaces. I've launched 100+ products across 3 continents, raised $50M+ in capital, and built the foundational layers that power entire ecosystems. I thrive at the intersection of technical complexity and market creation."

**Why This Works:**
- Immediately differentiated (not generic "product leader")
- Specific (emerging markets, infrastructure)
- Proven (100+ products, $50M+, 3 continents)
- Compelling (markets where infrastructure doesn't exist)

#### Add "When to Hire Me" Section:

```markdown
## When to Hire Me

I'm the right product leader when:

✓ You're building in an emerging market with limited infrastructure
✓ You need to ship fast without sacrificing technical depth
✓ You're transforming a single product into a multi-product platform
✓ You're expanding across geographies with different technical landscapes
✓ You need someone who can talk to developers, executives, and customers
✓ You're raising capital and need a product vision that attracts investors

I'm probably not the right fit if:

✗ You're competing in a mature market on features alone
✗ You need a design-first PM (I partner closely with design but lead with tech)
✗ You're optimizing an existing product rather than building new ones
✗ You prefer slow, consensus-driven decision-making
```

---

## 6. Evidence & Proof Analysis

### Current State: 3/10

**What Evidence You Currently Provide:**
- Job titles and dates (weak evidence—just shows you were employed)
- High-level metrics (decent but not detailed)
- Funding links (good—third-party validation)
- Company names (valuable for brand recognition)

**What's Missing:**
- Visual proof (no screenshots, no demos)
- Third-party voices (no testimonials)
- Process artifacts (no behind-the-scenes)
- Comparative proof (no before/after)
- External validation (no press mentions, no speaking)

### Top 1% Evidence Stack:

Exceptional portfolios layer multiple types of evidence to build unquestionable credibility:

#### 1. **Visual Evidence**

## 7. Copywriting Improvements

### Home Page Fixes:

#### Current Hero:
> "Building products that scale"

**Issues:**
- Generic (every PM claims this)
- Not differentiated
- Doesn't hint at your unique expertise

**Improved Options:**

**Option A (Infrastructure Angle):**
> "Building infrastructure products in markets where the infrastructure doesn't exist yet"

**Option B (Velocity Angle):**
> "From zero to 100+ products: Building and scaling at pace"

**Option C (Market Creation Angle):**
> "Creating new markets, not just competing in existing ones"

**Option D (Emerging Market Angle):**
> "Building products for emerging markets—from African fintech to global platforms"

**Recommendation:** Option A (most differentiated)

---

#### Current Subheadline:
> "Product leader with a decade of experience in product management, strategy, and go-to-market execution. Throughout my career, I've demonstrated a consistent ability to build products from scratch, attracting over $50 million in venture funding to support my product vision."

**Issues:**
- Starts with credentials (boring)
- Passive voice ("I've demonstrated")
- Funding metric unclear (did YOU raise it or companies you worked at?)
- Missing the "so what"

**Improved Version:**

> "I specialize in building infrastructure products for emerging markets—the foundational layers that power entire ecosystems. From open finance APIs in Africa to integration platforms for enterprises, I've launched 100+ products across 3 continents, contributed to raising $50M+ in venture funding, and scaled teams from 2 to 20+ people. I thrive at the intersection of technical complexity, market creation, and rapid execution."

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with differentiation (infrastructure + emerging markets)
- Specific examples (open finance, integration platforms)
- Multiple proof points (100+ products, $50M+, team building)
- Shows breadth (technical + strategic + execution)
- Active voice throughout

---

#### Current "My Approach":
> "I thrive on leading and developing high-performing R&D teams, partnering effectively with sales and marketing organizations, and tackling complex problems with a strategic, hands-on approach. My work combines rigorous data analysis with rapid experimentation, strategic product thinking with hands-on execution."

**Issues:**
- Generic corporate speak
- Could describe any senior PM
- No personality
- No specific examples

**Improved Version:**

> ## How I Work
>
> **I move fast without breaking things.** Launching 100+ products in 4 years taught me that speed beats perfection, but quality compounds. I ship quickly, iterate ruthlessly, and kill what doesn't work.
>
> **I build for developers and technical users.** The best B2B products have exceptional developer experience. I've learned that documentation is product, SDKs are marketing, and API design is UX design.
>
> **I thrive in ambiguity.** My best work happens in emerging markets where playbooks don't exist. Give me a nascent market, incomplete data, and technical constraints—I'll create the category.
>
> **I lead with context, not control.** I've built and led teams from 2 to 20+ people. My approach: hire people smarter than me, give them context and autonomy, and clear blockers relentlessly.
>
> **I use frameworks, but I'm not dogmatic.** RICE, CIRCLES, Jobs-to-be-Done—they're tools, not religion. I adapt them to the problem, the market, and the team.

**Why This Works:**
- Specific and opinionated
- Shows personality
- Backed by experience (100+ products, dev focus, team sizes)
- Memorable phrases ("speed beats perfection, but quality compounds")
- Shows philosophy, not just skills

---

### Work Page Fixes:

#### Current Work Page Intro:
> "On a mission to build beautiful, high-impact products that solve real customer problems. Here's a timeline of my journey so far:"

**Issues:**
- Generic mission statement
- "Beautiful" is designer language (you're infrastructure PM)
- Doesn't set up WHY someone should read this

**Improved Version:**

> ## My Work
>
> Over the past decade, I've specialized in building infrastructure products in emerging markets—places where the rules are still being written and the infrastructure doesn't yet exist. From open finance APIs in Africa to integration platforms for enterprises, I focus on creating new markets, not just competing in existing ones.
>
> Below is a timeline of the companies I've helped build, the problems we solved, and the impact we created. Each role represents a different challenge: category creation, business model transformation, competitive repositioning, and geographic expansion.

**Why This Works:**
- Sets up your unique positioning immediately
- Gives reader a reason to care (emerging markets, new categories)
- Previews what they'll learn (different types of challenges)
- More compelling than generic mission statement

---

### Individual Work Entry Fixes:

#### Current Okra Entry:
> "I joined Okra as their first product hire and played a pivotal role in building the company from the ground up."

**Issues:**
- "Pivotal role" is vague and self-congratulatory
- Doesn't show what changed because of you

**Improved Version:**

> "In May 2020, Okra had 8 bank integrations and served 12 companies. I joined as their first product hire with a mandate: build Africa's Plaid before anyone else did. By February 2024, we powered 100+ products across 150+ financial institutions in 3 countries, processing 2M+ API calls daily and establishing Okra as Africa's leading open finance infrastructure provider."

**Why This Works:**
- Concrete before/after (8 → 150+ integrations)
- Clear mission (build Africa's Plaid)
- Specific scale (2M+ API calls daily)
- Shows market position (leading provider)

---

#### Current Buildable Entry:
> "At Buildable.io (now rebranded as IntegrationOS), I played a crucial role in steering the company's transformation from a digital agency model to a product-centric organization."

**Issues:**
- "Crucial role" is vague
- Doesn't explain WHY the transformation mattered
- Missing metrics

**Improved Version:**

> "Buildable was a profitable digital agency with a scaling problem: revenue was linear with headcount. I joined to help transform the business from services to product. Over 12 months, I led the productization of recurring client patterns into 20+ microservices, built relationships with enterprise clients (Fanatics, Sonnet Insurance, Hubba), and contributed to the product vision that helped secure a $3.76M Series A in 2020. The company is now IntegrationOS, a venture-backed integration platform."

**Why This Works:**
- Explains the strategic challenge (linear revenue)
- Shows your role in solution (led productization)
- Concrete outcomes (20+ microservices, enterprise clients, Series A)
- Demonstrates strategic impact (agency → product company)

---

#### Current Bookmark Entry:
> "Initially joining Bookmark.com as their growth marketing and operations lead, I was quickly promoted to Head of Product."

**Issues:**
- Focuses on career progression, not impact
- Doesn't explain what made the promotion fast

**Improved Version:**

> "I joined Bookmark as their growth marketing and operations lead in July 2017. Within 6 months, I was promoted to Head of Product after identifying a strategic opportunity: repositioning our website builder with an 'AI-powered' focus to differentiate in a crowded market dominated by Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly. This positioning, combined with product scaling, led to Bookmark's strategic acquisition by Moneris in 2019."

**Why This Works:**
- Shows strategic thinking (identified repositioning opportunity)
- Explains promotion (saw opportunity, executed)
- Market context (dominated by Wix, etc.)
- Clear outcome (acquisition)

---

### Stats Section Improvements:

#### Current Stats:
- 10+ Years Experience
- $50M+ Capital Raised
- 100+ Products Shipped

**Improvements:**

Add context to make stats more meaningful:

**Option A: Add Subtext**
- **10+ Years Experience** → "From Marketing Intern to Product Lead"
- **$50M+ Capital Raised** → "Across 4 Venture-Backed Companies"
- **100+ Products Shipped** → "Across 3 Continents, 6 Markets"

**Option B: Add More Stats**
Create a 2x3 grid:
- **10+ Years** | PM Experience
- **100+ Products** | Shipped & Scaled
- **$50M+** | Capital Raised
- **3 Continents** | Africa, NA, Australia
- **150+ Integrations** | Built at Okra
- **4 Acquisitions/Exits** | Contributed To

**Option C: Make Stats Tell a Story**
Organize chronologically:
- **2011:** Started as Marketing Intern
- **2013:** First PM Role
- **2017:** First Head of Product Role
- **2020:** First Product Lead Hire
- **2024:** 100+ Products Later...

**Recommendation:** Option B (adds more impressive data points)

---

### Call-to-Action Improvements:

#### Current CTA:
> "Want to chat about product management, startups, or potential collaborations? Reach out on LinkedIn or check out my GitHub."

**Issues:**
- Vague ("chat about")
- No compelling reason to reach out
- "Potential collaborations" is unclear

**Improved Version:**

> ## Let's Talk If...
>
> ✓ You're building infrastructure products in emerging markets
> ✓ You need a PM who can ship 100+ products without sacrificing quality
> ✓ You're expanding internationally and need someone who's done it
> ✓ You're raising capital and need a product vision that resonates with investors
> ✓ You want to talk about African fintech, API design, or product velocity
>
> **Open to:** Senior PM / Director of Product / Head of Product roles | Advisory / Consulting | Speaking opportunities
>
> [LinkedIn] [Email] [GitHub] [Calendar]

**Why This Works:**
- Specific reasons to reach out (qualifying leads)
- Shows your unique value props
- Clear about what you're looking for
- Multiple contact methods

## Conclusion

Your portfolio has a strong foundation but is currently operating at 60-70% of its potential. The primary gaps are:

1. **No case studies** (biggest gap)
2. **Generic positioning** (second biggest gap)
3. **Missing visual/social proof**
4. **Surface-level metrics**
5. **No thought leadership**

**The good news:** You have exceptional experience to draw from. Okra alone is a case study goldmine (100+ products, 3-country expansion, infrastructure creation). With 60-80 focused hours, you can transform this into a top 1% portfolio.

**Start here:**
1. Rewrite home page (Week 1)
2. Build Okra case study (Weeks 2-4)
3. Gather testimonials and visual proof (Week 5)
4. Build second case study (Weeks 6-8)

**Expected outcome:** Portfolio that positions you for senior PM / Director of Product / Head of Product roles at top-tier tech companies or fast-growing startups, particularly those building infrastructure products or expanding to emerging markets.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this analysis
2. Prioritize recommendations based on time available
3. Set up project tracking (Notion, Linear, or simple checklist)
4. Start with home page rewrite (highest ROI for time invested)
5. Schedule 10 hours/week for portfolio work
6. Target: First case study published in 4 weeks
