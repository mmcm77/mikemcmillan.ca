## Key Concepts

### The 7-Section Structure
All case studies follow this proven framework:
1. **Hero** (15 sec) - Hook with power headline + stats
2. **Executive Summary** (30 sec) - Complete story in 3-4 sentences
3. **Problem** (1 min) - Business + user context with data
4. **Approach** (1.5 min) - Strategic framework and validation
5. **Process** (1.5 min) - How you executed cross-functionally
6. **Impact** (1 min) - Quantified outcomes with context
7. **Learnings** (45 sec) - Honest reflection and insights

**Total:** 4-6 minute read, 1,200-1,800 words

---

### Success Formula

**Every case study should:**
- ‚úÖ Lead with business impact, then explain how
- ‚úÖ Include 5+ metrics with full context (before/after/timeframe)

- ‚úÖ Show cross-functional leadership
- ‚úÖ Include honest reflections on what didn't work
- ‚úÖ Be scannable (headers, bullets, charts)

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to complete all three case studies before launching?**
A: No! Launch one at a time. Okra first (Week 4), then Buildable (Week 8), then Bookmark (Week 12).

**Q: What if I don't remember exact metrics?**
A: Use approximations with context ("~100 products" or "3x growth"). Focus on percentages if absolute numbers are fuzzy. Check old presentations, LinkedIn, or ask former colleagues.

**Q: How do I handle confidential information?**
A: Anonymize sensitive data, use percentages instead of absolutes, focus on strategic approach over proprietary details. When in doubt, ask for approval.

**Q: Can I use AI to help write these?**
A: Yes for first drafts and overcoming writer's block, but heavily edit to add personality and specifics. AI can't tell your unique story - you must.

**Q: What if I'm not a designer?**
A: Keep visuals simple and clean. Use Canva templates. Or hire a designer on Upwork for $300-500 per case study.

**Q: How long should each case study be?**
A: 1,200-1,800 words (4-6 minute read). Quality over length.
