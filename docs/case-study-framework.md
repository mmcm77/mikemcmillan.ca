## Writing Best Practices

### Voice & Tone
- **Active voice:** "I launched" not "The product was launched"
- **Confident but humble:** Own your wins, acknowledge team contributions
- **Specific over vague:** "Increased conversion 23%" not "Improved metrics significantly"
- **Show, don't tell:** Use concrete examples instead of self-praise

### Action Verbs for Impact
Use these to start sentences and bullets:
- **Strategy:** Developed, architected, defined, positioned, validated
- **Execution:** Launched, shipped, implemented, scaled, delivered
- **Leadership:** Led, coordinated, aligned, championed, drove
- **Analysis:** Analyzed, identified, discovered, uncovered, synthesized
- **Improvement:** Increased, reduced, optimized, accelerated, improved

### Data Presentation
- Always include timeframe for metrics
- Provide context (market average, industry benchmark)
- Use percentage AND absolute numbers when both matter
- Round to 2 significant figures for readability

**Example:**
- **Poor:** "Improved retention"
- **Better:** "Improved retention by 15%"
- **Best:** "Improved 30-day retention from 45% to 60% (+33% relative, +15pp absolute) within 3 months, outpacing industry average of 52%"

### Storytelling Structure
Follow the Situation-Complication-Resolution framework:
1. **Situation:** Set the scene with context
2. **Complication:** Introduce the problem/challenge
3. **Resolution:** Show how you solved it and the impact

### Scanability
- Use headers and subheaders liberally
- Bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bold key metrics and outcomes
- White space between sections
- Pull quotes to highlight insights

---

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Image Hierarchy
1. **Hero image:** Full-width, high-impact (1200x600px minimum)
2. **Section images:** Half-width or 2/3 width (800x500px)
3. **Inline screenshots:** Bordered, with captions
4. **Data visualizations:** Clean, branded, accessible

### Chart Types by Data Story

**Growth Over Time:**
- Line chart (preferred for trends)
- Area chart (emphasizes magnitude)

**Comparisons:**
- Bar chart (horizontal for many categories)
- Column chart (vertical for time periods)

**Part-to-Whole:**
- Stacked bar (shows composition over time)
- Donut chart (single composition, use sparingly)

**Relationships:**
- Scatter plot (correlation)
- Bubble chart (3 variables)

**Geographic:**
- Choropleth map (regional metrics)
- Pin map (location-specific data)

**Avoid:**
- 3D charts (distort perception)
- Pie charts with >5 slices
- Dual-axis charts (confusing)

### Design System Consistency
- Use consistent color palette across all charts
- Maintain typography hierarchy
- Standard spacing and margins
- Accessible color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Annotations on charts to guide reader

### Before/After Visuals
- Side-by-side comparison
- Slider for interactive comparison
- Annotate key differences
- Use same scale/framing for fairness

**Example 2-minute version:**
```
At Okra, we had successfully launched in Nigeria but needed to expand to
compete with well-funded rivals. I was tasked with leading our first
geographic expansion as Product Lead.

I developed a scoring framework evaluating regulatory environment, banking
API infrastructure, and market demand. South Africa and Kenya scored highest.
I led a cross-functional team through localized product adaptations,
partnerships with 75+ banks, and a phased rollout strategy.

We launched in both markets within 8 months, grew integrations from 25 to
100+, and added $XXM in ARR. This expansion established Okra as the leading
pan-African open finance platform and was cited in our Series B pitch.

The key learning: Resist the temptation to launch everywhere. Deep
localization in two markets beat surface-level presence in five. This
framework now guides all our market decisions.
```

### 60-Second Elevator Pitch
**Structure:**
1. Company + your role (5 seconds)
2. The challenge (10 seconds)
3. Your solution (20 seconds)
4. The impact (15 seconds)
5. The insight (10 seconds)

**Example:**
```
At Okra, Africa's open finance platform, I led product as we expanded from
one market to three. The challenge: competitors were raising massive rounds
to expand everywhere fast. We had to be strategic with limited resources.

I built a framework prioritizing markets by regulatory readiness and API
infrastructure. We went deep in South Africa and Kenya instead of shallow
everywhere. This meant custom integrations, local partnerships, and patient
market-building.

Result: 100+ bank integrations, $XXM in new ARR, and market leadership
position—all with 60% less capital than competitors. The framework became
our playbook for all expansion decisions.
