- ❌ No storytelling or narrative flow
- ❌ Desktop-only design thinking (no mobile-first consideration visible)
- ❌ Static content presentation
- ❌ Missing social proof, metrics visualization, impact stories

## Transformation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Design System** (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Modern Design System
- **Color palette:** Move beyond black/white
  - Primary brand color (suggests: electric blue, warm coral, or deep purple)
  - 60-30-10 rule: dominant neutral + supporting + accent
  - Dark mode + light mode support
  - Semantic color tokens (success, warning, info)

- **Typography hierarchy:**
  - Display fonts for headlines (consider: Clash Display, Cal Sans, or Syne)
  - Body copy (Inter is fine, or upgrade to Geist, Satoshi, or General Sans)
  - Mono font for technical details (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono)
  - Scale: 12px → 14px → 16px → 20px → 24px → 32px → 48px → 64px → 96px

- **Spacing system:**
  - 4px base unit
  - Consistent rhythm: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128px

- **Component library:**
  - Install shadcn/ui (built on Radix - you already have some Radix!)
  - Create: Cards, Badges, Pills, Tooltips, Modals
  - Animated buttons with hover states
  - Custom form inputs with focus states

#### 1.2 Layout Architecture
```
Proposed Structure:
/
├── Hero (above fold)
├── About/Philosophy section
├── Featured work carousel
├── Impact metrics dashboard
├── Skills/Expertise
└── CTA section

/work
├── Work timeline (interactive)
└── Detailed role cards

/case-studies (NEW)
├── /okra-expansion
├── /buildable-transformation
└── /bookmark-ai-pivot

/writing (NEW - optional)
└── Thought leadership articles

/contact (NEW)
└── Beautiful contact form
```

---

### **Phase 2: Hero Section Redesign** (Week 2)

#### Current Issues:
- Static text, no personality
- Buried value proposition
- No visual interest
- Weak CTA placement

#### Proposed Solution:
**Modern Hero Patterns:**

**Option A: Animated gradient + 3D elements**
- Large animated gradient mesh background
- Floating 3D objects (using Spline or Three.js)
- Oversized typography with text reveals
- Scroll indicator with smooth animation

**Option B: Bento grid layout**
- Grid of interactive cards showing:
  - Your photo/avatar
  - Years of experience counter
  - Companies worked with
  - Products shipped counter
  - Live availability status
  - Recent achievement

**Option C: Video/motion background**
- Subtle looping background video or Lottie animation
- Clean overlay with bold headline
- Glassmorphism cards for CTAs

**Recommended:** Bento grid - showcases multiple dimensions of your work immediately

**Key Elements:**
```
- Headline: "Building products that scale" or "Product leader who ships"
- Subhead: Concise value prop (10-15 words)
- Dynamic stats: "100+ products • $50M+ raised • 4 continents"
- Primary CTA: "View case studies"
- Secondary CTA: "Download résumé"
- Tertiary: Social links
```

---

### **Phase 3: Case Studies - THE GAME CHANGER** (Week 3-4)

**This is the most critical upgrade.** PMs are hired based on proven impact, not just experience.

#### Framework for Each Case Study:

**Structure:**
1. **Hero:** Project name + compelling visual
2. **Overview:** Role, timeline, company, team size
3. **Problem:** What was broken/opportunity identified
4. **Approach:** Your PM methodology
5. **Process:** Research → Strategy → Execution (with visuals)
6. **Impact:** Metrics, outcomes, business results
7. **Learnings:** Retrospective insights

**Visual Elements:**
- Before/after screenshots
- User flow diagrams
- Data visualizations (charts showing growth)
- Product screenshots with annotations
- Team photos (if available)
- Process artifacts (wireframes, PRDs, roadmaps - sanitized)

**Recommended Case Studies:**
1. **Okra Geographic Expansion** - GTM strategy, scaling
2. **Buildable Agency-to-Product Pivot** - Product strategy, fundraising
3. **Bookmark AI Positioning** - Repositioning, acquisition story

**Interactive Elements:**
- Expandable sections
- Image galleries/lightboxes
- Hover states revealing details
- Progress indicators
- Scroll-triggered animations

---

### **Phase 4: Visual Design & Micro-interactions** (Week 4-5)

#### 4.1 Animation Strategy

**Subtle, purposeful motion:**
- **Entrance animations:** Fade-up, slide-in (stagger for lists)
- **Scroll animations:** Parallax backgrounds, reveal on scroll
- **Hover states:** Scale, glow, color shift
- **Loading states:** Skeleton screens, spinners
- **Transitions:** Page transitions, route changes

**Libraries to implement:**
- Framer Motion (primary animation library)
- React Spring (physics-based)
- GSAP (advanced scroll-triggered)
- Lottie for branded animations

#### 4.2 Modern UI Patterns

**Glassmorphism:**
```css
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
```

**Neumorphism (subtle):**
- Soft shadows for depth
- Elevated cards

**Gradient accents:**
- Animated gradient text for headlines
- Gradient borders on cards
- Gradient buttons

**Floating elements:**
- Elevated cards with shadow
- Floating action buttons
- Sticky navigation with blur
